JivanLog v4 — Deployment Instructions
======================================

BEFORE uploading these files, open index.html in a text editor (Notepad is fine).

Find this line near the top:
  apiKey:"YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE",

Replace  YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE  with your actual new Firebase API key.
(Find it in: Firebase Console > gear icon > Project Settings > Your apps)

Then upload ALL 4 files to your gh-pages branch on GitHub:
  - index.html
  - sw.js
  - manifest.json
  - icon.svg

Do NOT upload HOW_TO_DEPLOY.txt — it is just for your reference.

See the Security Guide (Word document) for full step-by-step instructions.
